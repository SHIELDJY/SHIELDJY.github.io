I love the sun on a warm winter day

I love the grass in the early spring

I love the yard afternoon and the swing standing there

I love the ice of mid-summer

I love the moon in a cool autumn night

    where there is a lovely starry sky

I love the frog after a rain

I love the Apricot blossom on the hill

I love the aquarium on the Wednesday evening

    where sunset is glowing

I love the ducks in a crowd way

I love the messy shelf

    with a windy deck to see the lights faraway

I love to walk alone on the 69th Road

I love Kimura Takuya's long blondy hair

I love the deer free running on the field

I love the banyan tree in front of my grandma's door

I love the bento made by my mother

I love the Stubble on my father's face

I love the playground running late in a August night

I love the ring of class over

I love the blackout night

    with a pair of candles standing in the entrance of my house

I love the way the mountain is

    far away from my sight reaches

I love the ballon flying to the west of the sky

I love to step on the stone road in the morning

    passing by a crowded breakfast stand with grandpa's osmanthus cake

I love the way the cloud fading in the sky
    and the tree greening as it is

The final thing I love is

And the final thing you should know is that

    I love you.
