## About This Project

NeuroSim+ is an integrated simulation framework for benchmarking synaptic devices and array architectures in terms of the system-level learning accuracy and hardware performance metrics[[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8268337). Firstly introduced by [Prof. Yumeng Shi at GaTech](https://shimeng.ece.gatech.edu/), it has now iterated to its third version [MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0](https://github.com/neurosim/MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0). More information could be referred from the links below.

## Running the Instance

As stated in its [User Mannual](https://github.com/neurosim/MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0/blob/master/documents/NeuroSimV3.0_user_mannual.pdf)

>The tool is expected to run in Linux with required system dependencies installed. These include GCC, GNU make, GNU C libraries (glibc). We have tested the compatibility of the tool with a few different Linux environments, such as (1) Red Hat 5.11 (Tikanga), gcc v4.7.2, glibc 2.5, (2) Red Hat 7.3 (Maipo), gcc v4.8.5, glibc v2.1.7, (3) Ubuntu 16.04, gcc v5.4.0, glibc v2.23, and they are all workable.

Thus, a brand new virtual Ubuntu 16.04 running in VMWare Workstation 15.0 is established to help this model running.

However, during last trial, my 16GB memory for that virtual machine was used up and caused a major breakdown. Then I found that I was unable to access the Ubuntu with graphic but only command lines. I assume it was because I shut down the virtual machine compulsively without following the VMWare protocol and caused some protection mechanism. <u>**So, it is highly unrecommend to run this model with small memory and highly unrecommend to shut down the virtual machines causally.**</u>

Anyway, I found Ubuntu 16.04 is unbearably old and extremely unfriendly. So I set up a brand new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to run this instance. Noting that you should make sure the internet connection between the system and VMWare is all right since the installation process needs internet to install VM-Tool which enables the copy-paste between your Windows and Ubuntu as well as the full-screen feature. To ensure this connectivity, be aware that the 'network connection' should be set as 'Customized' and set it to 'VMnet8(NAT Mode)' as shown below.

Then press `Ctrl+Alt+T` to open the Terminal to do the common procedure for a brand new Ubuntu system

```shell
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Afterwards, install git, gcc, and g++ with

```shell
sudo apt-get install git

sudo apt-get install gcc

sudo apt-get install g++
```

Then follow the steps shown on  [MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0](https://github.com/neurosim/MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neurosim/MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0.git
```

Open that folder and extract the file `MNIST_data.zip` to itâ€™s current directory

```shell
cd MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0/

unzip MNIST_data.zip
```

Make the files

```shell
make
```

Following the instructions in the user guide provided in [User Manual](https://github.com/neurosim/MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0/blob/master/documents/NeuroSimV3.0_user_mannual.pdf), the terminal should output the information below.

According to the User Manual, there are several params that could be adjusted. They are listed below. Please refer to Section 5.3 in [User Manual](https://github.com/neurosim/MLP_NeuroSim_V3.0/blob/master/documents/NeuroSimV3.0_user_mannual.pdf) to get further information about the param and its usage. Here is just a simple list of them.

| Param                                    | Value(s)                                                     | File     |

To give it a try, we just use the default values and default device (`RealDevice`).

```shell
make run
```

and see the outputs.

Can see the accuracy from the last (125) epoch is 69.95%.

Also, the output log is stored in the `MLP-NeuroSim_V3.0` Directory as a txt file for the reference.
